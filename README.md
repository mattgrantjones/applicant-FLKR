# Application Form

I built this application form using React, Vite, TailwindCSS, React hook form and Zod for validation. 

I'd generally prefer a different user flow for setting a primary applicant (one that is explicit about setting only one primary applicant and doesn't imply you can have more than oneâ€”unlike a checkbox which affords multiple selections).

Ideally it would be something like a button "Set as the primary applicant" or a section in the form where you select one (and only one) applicant from a list.

I built the form and validation in such a way that it could be simply plugged into an existing form.

I hope you find the form easy to use and the code easy to read! 


Cheers!

Matt
